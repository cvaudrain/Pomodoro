reset()
seems to reset to 26min and 6min respectively- but this will not happen until reset() has been called. Remember that reset() is called as part of toggle().
and variable values

FIXED ---------affects html




Start()
after 1 minute, clock html always goes to 4:59 and counts down from there
VARIABLE values are not effected.


FIXED:
break():
 FIXED====the minutes variable is fine, html for button does not change
 FIXED------AFTER break is called, clock html will always revert to 5min,


Trying:
seoncds = 0, not 60

moving this statement to immediately after the decrement at the beginning:
if(seconds==0){
  minutes -=1;
  minPassed+=1;
  seconds = 60; //will be decremented prior to setting the HTML onscreen, so it will go from :00 to :59 smoothly.
  $("#Minutes").html(minutes);
}

Replacing conditionals to simply assign minutes html to be minutes-1
